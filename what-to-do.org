* Some things that didn't go as planned
** I thought multithreading the process of the cell count would be a lot faster, however it often slows down my program.
** Might not end up using the GPU as currently I do not know a way to use a graphics api, ex CUDA and link it with my program
* Things to try out
** Maybe use OpenCl for getting cells on the board
